<p>I've been a member of the Wayward team since December 2016. Originally my changes were small, but quickly I got into redesigning and reimplementing the UI, and since then I've been active in all aspects of the game, from UI/UX redesign to rewriting systems to improving the modder experience.</p>
<p>I'm not completely happy with Wayward overall yet, but I'm still actively working on it and often adding things that I'm super proud of!</p>
