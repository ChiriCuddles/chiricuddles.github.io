title: A Very Girly Sleepover to Which I Was Not Invited
---

<style>.c1{font-style: italic;}</style>

<p class="c2"><span class="c0">I hated when my sister had sleepovers. The house was absolutely filled with cute girls and cute clothes and stuffed animals and giggling and it all made me want to scream. I didn&rsquo;t even know why it all got to me as much as it did, but really, it grated against my soul.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>As usual, I was assuming the reason I hated all this girly stuff so much was because I was... well.... a boy</span><span>.</span><span>&nbsp;Well on my way to becoming a...... man. And I guessed that....... boys usually hated their sisters&rsquo; sleepovers. So I was just like any other one, as much as that notion made me sick to my stomach. Clearly I really valued my individuality to get sick at something like that, right? Either that or I was just sick of my sister and her friends rolling their eyes at me and saying &ldquo;boys&rdquo; as if I was part of some horrible.... boy thing. It wasn&rsquo;t as if I had any control over me being... </span><span class="c1">this</span><span>, after all</span><span>!</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Anyway, long story short, my sister was having a sleepover again, and I was currently hiding in my room, under all my covers, listening to all the laughter and giggles and, like I said, trying not to scream</span><span>.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>But there was a problem. It was about to be dinner time, and I was starving, and Mum had ordered pizza</span><span>.</span><span>&nbsp;I didn&rsquo;t think I could hide in my room during that, which meant that I&rsquo;d have to face all of those girls in order to not go hungry. And the idea of that sent chills down my spine. They would </span><span class="c1">see</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;me! And they would roll their eyes and say &ldquo;boys!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span>I was terrified</span><span>.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Maybe I should go hungry? Maybe I should skip the pizza and sneak down for a slice after they&rsquo;d all gone to sleep? If they hadn&rsquo;t eaten it all by that point, anyway.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Girls! Pizza&rsquo;s here!&rdquo; Mum called, and the anxiety in my gut rose to new heights. Or maybe that was hunger, because at that moment my stomach also growled.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Still hiding under my covers, peeking out at the closed door, I listened as all the girls ran to the kitchen, their footsteps like a stampede.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And then the coast was clear. Should I... head down after them for pizza? </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But then when I went into the room they&rsquo;d all see me! </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And they&rsquo;d probably roll their eyes and go &ldquo;boys!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c2"><span>I really didn&rsquo;t want that to happen</span><span>!</span></p><p class="c2"><span>If only I could blend in better... if only they wouldn&rsquo;t see me and go &ldquo;boys.&rdquo; If only they&rsquo;d see one of... their </span><span class="c1">own</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;kind, instead. </span></p><p class="c2"><span>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I wasn&rsquo;t saying I wanted to be a girl, of course not, I definitely hadn&rsquo;t spent that long considering that possibility; it was only a few times a day after all</span><span>.</span><span>&nbsp;But like, if I </span><span class="c1">was</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;a girl, I could blend in on nights like tonight. And that would be so much better.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>But you know... the coast </span><span class="c1">was</span><span>&nbsp;clear. I </span><span class="c1">could</span><span>&nbsp;sneak into my sister&rsquo;s room... with how many girls there were, I could probably find stuff to...... </span><span class="c1">disguise</span><span>&nbsp;myself</span><span>.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;You know, so that the girls wouldn&rsquo;t all immediately roll their eyes at me and go &ldquo;boys.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Then again, I didn&rsquo;t actually have any idea how to... well... disguise myself as a girl. And it wasn&rsquo;t as if I had time to learn. It wasn&rsquo;t like I could just put on a wig or hair extensions and a bit of makeup. I didn&rsquo;t know how to put on makeup, after all. Or hair extensions. If only, though, right? Then this would be so much easier</span><span>.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Finally I sighed. Even if I did try something like that, what if I was caught in the act? It would be so much worse if I was caught trying to wear girl&rsquo;s clothes and makeup by </span><span class="c1">actual</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;girls. I was pretty sure I&rsquo;d literally sink into the ground in my shame. Maybe past the ground, even, maybe in my shame I&rsquo;d sink so far into the earth that I&rsquo;d end up on the other side of the planet.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">So... yeah. That wasn&rsquo;t the best of ideas.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">My stomach growled again as the smell of pizza wafted into the room, and I sighed. I would have to face rolling eyes and the girls going &ldquo;boys&rdquo; after all.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Slowly, dejectedly, I slid out of my bed and meandered my way to the kitchen, only spending a few moments staring wistfully into the very pink and girly bedroom that the girls had vacated.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">When I got to the kitchen, seeing the eight or so girls crowding around the table eating pizza and drinking soda, I grumbled to myself. Nobody had noticed me yet, and maybe they wouldn&rsquo;t either. You could always hope, right?</span></p><p class="c2"><span>And then they all stopped and stared at me, and my sister laughed, &ldquo;Have you </span><span class="c1">seen</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;your bed head?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">No, don&rsquo;t... don&rsquo;t say it...</span></p><p class="c2"><span>She rolled her eyes. &ldquo;Boys.</span><span>&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Every one of those eyes watched me as my heart shattered. Every one of those eyes watched me as, somehow, for once in my teenage life, it actually </span><span class="c1">got</span><span>&nbsp;to me. Every one of those eyes watched me as </span><span class="c1">tears </span><span>welled up and I turned around and tried to get away, my legs turning to jelly before I could and a pitiful sob escaping</span><span>.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What did you just do?&rdquo; I heard one of the girls ask. </span></p><p class="c2"><span>&ldquo;I... don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; my sister said. &ldquo;Lemme get out.</span><span>&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I tried to stop my tears, I tried to stop my sobs, but now that it had started I wasn&rsquo;t sure I could. Where had this come from? I hadn&rsquo;t cried in so long, and...</span></p><p class="c2"><span>From the kitchen there was suddenly a lot of loud noises as the legs of chairs scraped against the floor and girls grunted and squeaked and squealed. &ldquo;Ow! You stepped on my hair!</span><span>&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span>And then a moment later, footsteps came close, and again I tried to stop crying, but I couldn&rsquo;t. It was weird, too, because I knew that boys weren&rsquo;t supposed to do this kind of thing! And... well, so far, since puberty had started, at least, I </span><span class="c1">hadn&rsquo;t</span><span class="c0">. </span></p><p class="c2"><span>Maybe I wasn&rsquo;t a boy after all</span><span>?</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;...No, that would be ridiculous.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Are... are you okay?&rdquo; my sister asked. &ldquo;Why are you crying? Was it because I teased you about the bed head?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I dunno,&rdquo; I mumbled, my voice sounding squeaky and hoarse. I couldn&rsquo;t look at her, either, my eyes were squeezed shut and I was curled up into a ball.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m... I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t realise you were going to cry...&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t either,&rdquo; I sniffled. &ldquo;I... it hurts when you roll your eyes like that and... say I&rsquo;m just a boy.</span><span>&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span>&ldquo;It... hurts when I say you&rsquo;re a </span><span class="c1">boy?</span><span class="c0">&rdquo; she asked, flabbergasted. &ldquo;But... aren&rsquo;t you...&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t knooow!&rdquo; I sobbed.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She didn&rsquo;t say anything, and for a second I wondered if she&rsquo;d left me and gone back to the kitchen. Hesitantly, I opened my eyes and... she was still there! Staring right at me! I choked and closed them tight again.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>&ldquo;I have an idea,</span><span>&rdquo;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;she said suddenly. &ldquo;Can you get up? Come with me to my room, okay?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Reluctantly, I looked between her and the kitchen. Then my stomach grumbled in protest and for a moment I was terrified she was going to roll her eyes at me and say &ldquo;boys&rdquo; again, but for once she did not, instead wearing a guilty expression. &ldquo;Please?&rdquo; she asked.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>&ldquo;O-okay,&rdquo; I mumbled, and she smiled and dragged me up and away</span><span>.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And then I was in her room, surrounded by pink and by makeup and by colourful clothes in all kinds of styles and by stuffed animals and all kinds of other things, and I felt so very out of place. &ldquo;Why are we here?&rdquo; I asked, my voice very tiny.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to try making it so that </span><span class="c1">nobody</span><span>&nbsp;can roll their eyes at you and say you&rsquo;re a boy,</span><span>&rdquo;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;she said, opening her closet and rifling through drawers and the racks. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your favourite colour?&rdquo; she asked.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Wait, was she trying to... do exactly what I&rsquo;d considered doing myself</span><span>?</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Was she going to make me look like a girl? But... I was terrified of that. What if the other girls gave me weird looks!</span></p><p class="c2"><span>&ldquo;I... hate colours,</span><span>&rdquo;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;I said.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She stopped rifling through the drawers, giving me a long look. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your favourite colour?&rdquo; she asked again, this time in deadpan.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I looked at my feet, trying to ignore how hot my face felt. &ldquo;Purple.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Of course it is,&rdquo; she said, turning back to the drawers. &ldquo;Can you come here for a moment?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span>I slowly got a bit closer, and she rolled her eyes, and I tensed up, but all she did was yank me closer. &ldquo;Hold this,&rdquo; she pushed a purple dress into my arms. &ldquo;And this. And these. And this. And this one too. Hmm... and... this.</span><span>&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Then, my arms absolutely filled with clothes, mostly purples, she pulled me away and had me dump them all on her bed. &ldquo;Skirt, dress, or pants?&rdquo; she asked, tracing the clothes with her hands. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Umm...&rdquo; I started.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Sorry, wasn&rsquo;t asking you,&rdquo; my sister said. &ldquo;I think... you&rsquo;ll do best in a skirt.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I... but...&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Please?&rdquo; she asked me.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>I blushed and nodded again, and she reached up to pat my head. &ldquo;Good girl.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span>And then my heart stopped again, but this time rather than being shattered, and horribly painful, I just couldn&rsquo;t breathe. She&rsquo;d... but... I... I wasn&rsquo;t... she..</span><span>.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Deep breaths,&rdquo; she said, patting my back now. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I choked, and then coughed, and took a shaky breath, and another.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Girl. Why had she... even if that was... I wasn&rsquo;t...... I wasn&rsquo;t a girl</span><span>!</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;So why did it stop my heart to hear someone say I was?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">After I&rsquo;d spent a moment or two taking deep breaths, she patted my back again. &nbsp;And then... &ldquo;Good girl,&rdquo; she said again, this time with a playful smirk on her face.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>That time it didn&rsquo;t stop my heart, though, instead my pulse quickened and the blush on my face got much worse. I didn&rsquo;t understand, I didn&rsquo;t understand at all. Why was this having such an effect on me? I... I was pretty sure I </span><span class="c1">liked</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;it. </span></p><p class="c2"><span>Why did I like being called a girl</span><span>?</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Why did I like being called a </span><span class="c1">good</span><span>&nbsp;girl</span><span>?</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Chills ran all throughout my body</span><span>.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Okay, now put on this skirt, and this blouse, okay?&rdquo; my sister said, shoving them at me before turning to dash back out of the room, shutting the door behind her.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>I gulped, feeling the clothes in my arms. They were soft... and they were pretty... and I was sure if </span><span>I was a girl I&rsquo;d love to wear them</span><span>, but......... I </span><span class="c1">wasn&rsquo;t</span><span>. I wished I was, but..</span><span>.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>This was probably the only chance I&rsquo;d ever get to wear them, though. This kind of opportunity didn&rsquo;t happen more than once. It wasn&rsquo;t normal for a........ boy to get the chance to wear girls&rsquo; clothes</span><span>.</span><span>&nbsp;So if I wanted a chance to experience what it would be like if I </span><span class="c1">had</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;been born a girl... this was probably my only chance.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I swallowed again, then nervously pulled off my shirt and pants, and then very quickly pulled on the skirt and blouse instead. And then... I was just standing there, awkwardly, in girls clothes. They fit fine, but...</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">My sister barged back into the room. &ldquo;You did it! Good girl!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I blushed.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>&ldquo;Okay, so, since you haven&rsquo;t been shaving your legs and we don&rsquo;t really have time to deal with that right now... lemme see if I have any clean thigh-highs</span><span>.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Also I can see your boxers, so we&rsquo;re gonna have to deal with that too.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I choked. &ldquo;H-how?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, I think I have some unopened panties,&rdquo; my sister said, digging through her drawers again.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>&ldquo;P-p-p-p-&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;P-recisely,&rdquo; she finished for me, then two long, black socks and something rolled-up landed on my lap. &ldquo;You know what to do; I&rsquo;ll be right back again!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span>And then for a second time, I was alone, but this time it was much harder. I was supposed to wear</span><span>..................</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">panties?</span><span class="c1">!</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">At this rate I was going to sink into the ground all the way to the other side of the planet without even having anyone see me!</span></p><p class="c2"><span>But at the same time... a little voice in my head told me that they were just underwear. That there was no real difference between them and anything I normally wore... besides the fact that I wouldn&rsquo;t look dumb with boxer shorts sticking out of this skirt..</span><span>.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hesitantly, nervously, reluctantly... I pulled them off, and unrolled the new pair of...... girls&rsquo; underwear.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>This was dumb. I felt dumb. I probably looked like a gross idiot</span><span>.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;If anybody looked in here right now they&rsquo;d see some........ boy putting on....... his sister&rsquo;s......... underwear and they&rsquo;d either burst out laughing or be absolutely disgusted.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I was terrified, but...... I swallowed. I had to do it. Well, no, I didn&rsquo;t have to, but... </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Aggggh!</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Before I could think about it any more, I pulled them on and then took a deep, calming breath.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Don&rsquo;t think about what you&rsquo;re doing. Don&rsquo;t think about how gross this probably is. Don&rsquo;t think about&mdash;</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Why did this feel better than the boxers</span><span>?</span><span>&nbsp;They were soft and a bit tighter, but also more elastic and... just... they felt </span><span class="c1">better</span><span class="c0">. I was so confused. Why wasn&rsquo;t all underwear like this?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I let myself fall onto the bed, sitting there in a white skirt and the pretty purple shirt and... I felt... strange. I hadn&rsquo;t ever felt like this before. While my heart was still absolutely racing, there was also a growing sense of calm inside me that I&rsquo;d never before experienced.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Another minute or so passed by, and then the door burst open for the second time. I was still in the middle of pulling on the second thigh-high sock, and my sister ran over to me, practically skipping. &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s turning out </span><span class="c1">wonderful!</span><span>&nbsp;You are going to be </span><span class="c1">so. Cute.</span><span>&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I felt my face heat up again. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be mean,&rdquo; I whined.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She looked disappointed. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want to be cute, then?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Well... I mean... wouldn&rsquo;t most people? I just... I couldn&rsquo;t possibly be cute, </span><span>I&rsquo;m....... a........</span><span>&nbsp;you know. I&rsquo;m not really a girl.</span><span>&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span>She shook her head. &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t joking, you really are going to be cute... But, well, we&rsquo;ll save that topic for later</span><span>.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;How do you feel about us doing something with your hair now?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I gave her a small nod.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes! Awesome, okay... So, have a seat over at the vanity, lemme grab my brush...&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I did so and then she began to brush my hair, making generous use of a spray bottle of water to neaten my bed head.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t my hair be too short?&rdquo; I mumbled. Wouldn&rsquo;t I need extensions or something?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Your hair is perfect just the way it is, I can style it to look nice and girly. Well.. unless you want it longer. Do you want extensions?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">My face warmed and I looked down again.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>&ldquo;I will take that as a yes,&rdquo; my sister laughed</span><span>.</span></p><h4 class="c3" id="h.at4nho7csa3m"><span class="c5">~</span></h4><p class="c2"><span class="c0">My hair... was long. Okay, well, technically it wasn&rsquo;t my hair, but it felt like it was my hair, and it looked like it was my hair, and it was long. I stared at the mirror, completely transfixed. Something so simple really made such a big difference?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;See? What did I tell you. Cute!&rdquo; my sister giggled. I glanced at her, then back at me, and this time I could see just how red my cheeks were.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Besides the blush, we really didn&rsquo;t look that different... and.... why did I </span><span class="c1">like</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;that? </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I was so confused. </span></p><p class="c2"><span>I liked looking like a girl, and I liked wearing girls&rsquo; clothes, and I liked being called cute... it all made me... </span><span class="c1">happy</span><span>. I&rsquo;d thought I hated girly stuff... it had always made me uncomfortable before, but... now that I was </span><span class="c1">in</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;it... </span></p><p class="c2"><span>It felt </span><span class="c1">right</span><span>.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>For the very first time in a very long time, I realised that I was smiling. And my sister realised it too, and I was pretty sure she was about to have a meltdown with how excited she looked. She suddenly spun around, squealing something that I could barely make out, something about &ldquo;being a sister</span><span>&rdquo;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;or something, and then dashed out of the room, leaving me alone to just blink at the empty doorway.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>I turned back to the mirror and smiled again, and a tingling warmth appeared in my tummy. Was that... butterflies? Wasn&rsquo;t that supposed to happen when you had a crush on someone? </span><span class="c1">Did I have a crush on myself</span><span class="c1">?</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Okay, no, that didn&rsquo;t make any sense. But still... why was I so... </span><span class="c1">happy?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I waved to my reflection, and all I saw was a cute girl waving back. That was... me!</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hi!&rdquo; I said.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ew, no, okay, voice wasn&rsquo;t very good. &ldquo;Hi,&rdquo; I said again, trying to be higher pitched this time. &ldquo;Hi. Hi hi hi hi hi.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It sounded weird when I just tried to change my pitch; I decided that I didn&rsquo;t think it had anything to do with that.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">How would my sister say hi? &ldquo;Hi!&rdquo; I said again.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Oh! Okay. That&rsquo;s way better. </span></p><p class="c2"><span>&ldquo;Hi, I&rsquo;m...</span><span>&rdquo;</span><span>&nbsp;I trailed off. </span><span>I didn&rsquo;t even have a name! Why did the author that wrote this story not name me? How rude?</span><span>?</span></p><p class="c2"><span>And suddenly my sister burst back into the room. &ldquo;I have returned!&rdquo; she shouted. &ldquo;Along with the rest of the... Girl Squad!!</span><span>&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A few other girls peeked out from behind her, and I shrunk down on the stool slightly. What if they didn&rsquo;t think I looked like a girl? What if...</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You have a sister?&rdquo; one of them asked.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>&ldquo;I have a sister!&rdquo; my sister declared. </span><span>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t she adorable?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span>The girls all nodded in agreement, and I shrunk down even more, hiding my face behind my hands. It was one thing to think I was maybe a little cute, it was another thing entirely to have a bunch of girls </span><span class="c1">all </span><span>say I&rsquo;m </span><span class="c6 c1">adorable!</span></p><p class="c2"><span>One girl off to the side spoke up. &ldquo;Why is there a pair of boxers on the floor?</span><span>&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Everyone stared at the offending underwear in shock. Including me. What was I supposed to do? How would I get out of this one? Why did my sister bring the girls back without us cleaning up?</span></p><p class="c2"><span>&ldquo;Well, girls, something </span><span class="c1">magical</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;happened tonight,&rdquo; my sister said, pinching the waistband between her fingers, lifting them up, and ever-so-carefully dropping them into a nearby trash can. &ldquo;You know about my brother, yes?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The girls all nodded, and I blanched.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>&ldquo;Well, he is no more! Gone! </span><span>Vanquished!</span><span>&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">What?</span></p><p class="c2"><span>&ldquo;Wow!&rdquo; one of the girls gasped. &ldquo;You killed him?!</span><span>&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; my sister grinned. &ldquo;Wait, no, don&rsquo;t be ridiculous. I turned him into a girl. She&rsquo;s my sister now.&rdquo; And then she gestured back towards me and I felt as though my whole &lsquo;sinking the entire way through the earth&rsquo; theory might come true after all</span><span>.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s great! Because boys are icky!&rdquo; one of the other girls said.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A few others nodded in agreement. I nodded as well... </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">What? I mean, it was true!</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Now...&rdquo; my sister said, revealing her other hand, which had been holding the basket of makeup supplies I&rsquo;d seen before in Mum&rsquo;s closet. &ldquo;Does anybody know any makeup? Because I wanna make her even cuter,&rdquo; she grinned.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A few girls raised their hands.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>&ldquo;Perfect! And then we can do her fingernails too!</span><span>&rdquo;</span></p><h4 class="c3" id="h.4j2fsl7o8hb7"><span class="c5">~</span></h4><p class="c2"><span>Being a girl was probably the strangest thing I&rsquo;d ever done. It wasn&rsquo;t... </span><span class="c1">hard</span><span>, it was just... </span><span class="c1">different</span><span>. And it made me feel so much better about the sleepover. </span><span>Now that I was one of them</span><span>, I could just have fun and relax along with them, and that was </span><span class="c1">infinitely</span><span>&nbsp;better than having to listen or see from the outside</span><span>.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>And for the whole night &mdash; the whole sleepover... I was with them all the whole time. I was with them as they finished giving me my makeover (duh)... </span><span>I was with them as they watched a rom-com</span><span>&nbsp;(it wasn&rsquo;t very good, but it was </span><span class="c1">kinda</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;funny and made waaaay more so because I was alongside a bunch of other girls giggling about it)...</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Well, okay, maybe I wasn&rsquo;t there the </span><span class="c1">entire</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;time &mdash; I did have to take a break at one point to have a bit of the pizza so that I didn&rsquo;t starve. My stomach had growled embarrassingly loudly at the end of my makeover and they&rsquo;d all pushed me to the kitchen, where I&rsquo;d eaten a slice of pizza and Mum had stared at me, blinking in confusion.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>But, yeah, point being, I was part of the </span><span class="c1">whole</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;sleepover. I was with them as they played spin the bottle, I was with them as they had a pillow fight, I was with them that evening as they all began to set up their sleeping bags and we started having a conversation about crushes...</span></p><p class="c2"><span>There was just </span><span class="c1">so much!</span><span>&nbsp;And it was all </span><span class="c1">fun</span><span class="c1">!</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">Honestly, I didn&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d ever laughed so much in my entire life. Or... no, that had probably all been giggling, not laughing. Because my laugh maybe got a bit girlier because of the whole voice thing I was doing, I guess?</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Sometime after the movie, and while the rest of the girls prepared their sleeping bags, my sister had sat down close next to me on her bed and leaned in. It was warm there... a warmth was inside me with which I wasn&rsquo;t yet familiar. I hadn&rsquo;t been at all comfortable being so close to my family in a </span><span class="c1">long</span><span>&nbsp;time... as long as I could </span><span class="c1">remember</span><span>.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But now... I was. I leaned in close as well, resting my head on my sister&rsquo;s shoulder. I swear, at that I almost teared up again. &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; I whispered.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>&ldquo;No problem, sis</span><span>,</span><span class="c0">&rdquo; she said, patting my leg. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m happy you&rsquo;re happy.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m </span><span class="c1">so</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;happy.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She didn&rsquo;t say anything for a moment, and we watched as the girls fought each other in front of us, a desperate king-of-the-hill battle over who got the spot closest to the heat vent. (The weather was a bit chilly and that spot would be warm, obviously. It was valuable!)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I never guessed that you might be a girl,&rdquo; my sister finally said.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>&ldquo;...What? I only just became a girl tonight</span><span>.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She gave me a long look. &ldquo;Umm... Okay, do you think you&rsquo;ll ever want to be a boy again?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ew! No! Blech!&rdquo; I stuck out my tongue for effect.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Okay... if you&rsquo;d known how happy you&rsquo;d be as a girl, do you think you would have wanted to be one back then?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span>&ldquo;Probably!&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d never realised that the reason I hated sleepovers so much was because I couldn&rsquo;t be part of them too. And... it was maybe more than just hating sleepovers... I </span><span class="c1">maaaaybe</span><span>&nbsp;thought I hated a </span><span class="c1">whole</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">bunch</span><span>&nbsp;of stuff that I think I was actually just jealous about... Honestly, if I&rsquo;d known I could just be a girl and that it would make me </span><span class="c1">this</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;happy I think I&rsquo;d have really wanted to be one!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span>&ldquo;Then... sis... weren&rsquo;t you </span><span class="c1">always</span><span>&nbsp;a girl?</span><span>&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;...What? I don&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span>She sighed and pulled away, and I pouted at her. Her shoulder was leaving... but it was so comfy..</span><span>.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And then she tapped my forehead with a finger. &ldquo;You. Can be a girl. Even if your body&rdquo; &mdash; she gestured to my whole body &mdash; &ldquo;is not. And wasn&rsquo;t that the case before now? Why else would you have been so jealous if you weren&rsquo;t a girl the whole time?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I... I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; I admitted. &ldquo;Maybe you have a point.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Of course I have a point! I&rsquo;m a genius. You saw the way I dealt with the whole boxers situation, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span>&ldquo;Okay... yeah, that </span><span class="c1">was</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;pretty good.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She shot me a smug smile. &ldquo;Thought so.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">We sat there for another moment, then, watching as one of the girls &mdash; the final king-of-the-hill &mdash; cackled maniacally while pointing and laughing at all the losers.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>&ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;ve always been a girl, then,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s... huh.</span><span>&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">At that moment, someone cleared their throat at the door. &ldquo;Okay, girls,&rdquo; Mum said. &ldquo;I know you&rsquo;re all excited, but it&rsquo;s getting late now. I can see that all your sleeping bags aren&rsquo;t set up... how many of you still need to brush your teeth? And put on jammies?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">All of us raised our hands.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I figured,&rdquo; Mum laughed. &ldquo;Go on and brush your teeth, girls. One at a time, okay? Don&rsquo;t go poking each other&rsquo;s eyes out with your toothbrush or elbowing each other to get to the sink.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And with that the stampede of girls all ran past, leaving just Mum, my sister, and I.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Mum gave us a look, then pulled the vanity stool close and took a seat. &ldquo;So it looks like I have two daughters tonight, huh?&rdquo; she smiled.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I looked down at my feet, feeling that blush come back. &ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; I squeaked.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You look very cute, honey,&rdquo; she murmured, carefully reaching close and brushing my hair behind my ear. &ldquo;Do you have something to tell me?&rdquo; &nbsp;she asked, giving me another gentle smile.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I... I think I was supposed to be a girl, Mum,&rdquo; I mumbled, feeling my eyes getting misty again. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, I...&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span>&ldquo;Hey, shhhh,&rdquo; she said, leaning close and pulling me into her arms. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay, baby girl. It&rsquo;s okay.</span><span>&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And then the mist turned into tears, which turned into sobs that I knew were completely melting away the makeup I was wearing. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I hated not being part of this,&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;I hated having to watch. I hated when I was lumped in with boys, I hate boys...&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You hate boys? You sure seemed to blush a lot when we were talking about the cute ones earlier...&rdquo; my sister interjected, the smugness audible in her tone.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s... that&rsquo;s different!&rdquo; I said, knowing I was definitely blushing again. &ldquo;Okay, well... fine, I hated </span><span class="c1">being</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;a boy.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You never were,&rdquo; Mum said, running her fingers through my hair. &ldquo;You never were. I&rsquo;m sorry I never realised, my sweet daughter. I&rsquo;m so sorry.&rdquo; She hugged me tight. &ldquo;Things will get better now. I&rsquo;ll make sure of it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I wasn&rsquo;t sure how long I was in her arms, my heart warm, hot tears continuing to streak down my cheeks. It lasted long enough that eventually the other girls started coming back, one at a time.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You two should probably head off to brush your teeth as well,&rdquo; Mum murmured, brushing my hair out of my face one last time and giving me a warm smile, one which quickly turned to a sigh. &ldquo;Did you two get into my makeup?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">My sister blanched. &ldquo;It was for a good cause!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Mum rolled her eyes at us. &ldquo;Girls</span><span>.</span><span class="c0">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span>I couldn&rsquo;t help it, I grinned, another round of butterflies fluttering around my tummy. </span><span class="c1">That</span><span>&nbsp;was a group I was </span><span class="c1">okay</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;being part of.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That we are,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;That we are.&rdquo;</span></p>
