		Snowbound is a story about two roommates being trapped. Trapped by life, by society... by their situations they feel powerless to change.
		
		VR should be an escape, but can it still be, when you're snowbound? Instead, confined to a small space, and with a bit of chemistry or magic, the two could form a bond tighter than they ever would have thought was possible.`);
